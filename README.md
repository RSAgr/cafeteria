Methodology

Data Collection:

Gather historical cafeteria data, including timestamps, meal preferences, and how often they visit.

Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Clustering Analysis:

Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to group customers based on their booking behaviors.

Identify distinct customer segments (e.g., morning visitors, lunch-hour rush).

Markov Chain Modeling:

Use Markov Chains to model transitions between different time slots (e.g., morning → lunch → evening).

Calculate transition probabilities to predict future cafeteria usage patterns.

Evaluation:

Validate clustering results using metrics like silhouette score or Davies-Bouldin index.

Test Markov Chain predictions against actual data to assess accuracy.

Visualization:

Create heatmaps or time-series plots to visualize peak hours and customer clusters.

Provide intuitive dashboards for stakeholders to monitor trends.
